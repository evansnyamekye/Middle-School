                    <p> • Infant school - Akwaaba!<br>
                        We wish to welcome every Parents/Guardain to Says international Infant school homePage. At SIS,
                        Our infant School provides
                        education to children aged between 3 months - 2 years respecfully. the following outlines the
                        infant school class categorization.<br><br>
                        • Babies:
                        Well trained teachers are engaged to handle children at the age of 6 months old, Most babies at
                        this stage are able to sit up without the support of anyone and are
                        able to sit well on table and chairs. With this, Says international school has the facility for
                        every baby to play more physical games such as Peekaboo, Tummy-time, singing,
                        kicking, clapping, and many others.
                        <br><br>
                        • Toddlers/Infant:
                        Our well trained teachers are able to facilitate early child education for toddlers in the most
                        effective way. Our curriculum ensures Toddlers are always learning by doing,
                        touching, moving, pushing and listening to develop understanding in every academic work they
                        come across with. this is off much interest to us as a school since it will foster their
                        development in studying.
